This repo contains Python code written by Amanda Zhang and Carah Alexander for a RDCEP project analyzing residential energy use patterns.
There is code showing how we compiled CSV data into an SQL database, how we wrote extracted commonly used SQL data in to more user-friendly CSVs, and the various ways we plotted the data to find patterns in energy consumption.
